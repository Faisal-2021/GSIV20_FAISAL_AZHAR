List page that shows all the movie card

I used a **TAILWINDCss** to design all the components because tailwind gives great control and it is easy and Rapidly website build Css tools.
I design a component acording to the given challenge and add some more functionality to make better user experience,these additional functionality are :
(i).  When user hover over a Movie Card then Card will be zoomIn and movie title color change to look more attractive on eye.
(ii). Improved the Overall Card design rating color change based on movie rating if rating >5 then color is 'GREEN' if and if rating < 5 color is 'RED' , also rating will rotate         on focus to look more good and user notice rating off the movie.
(iii).On movie card user can read complete overview of the movie with the help of scroll without open the detail of the movie that functionality provide better user experience to       the users.
(iv). When user scroll many pages and wants to go on top of the page then there is a button that scroll to the top of the website .

Used a useNavigate() to navigate user to the movieDetail page and use it's State to pass movieId props to the Detail page.
On movie Detail page useLocation sis used to access the state .
